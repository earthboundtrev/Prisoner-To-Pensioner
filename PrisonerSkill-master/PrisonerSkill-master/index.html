            <p class="body">
                People deserve a second chance. Especially those who have been falsely imprisoned, or have reformed while in prison. 
                A person who is remain true to themselves, and not let the environment of prison control who they are is someone with 
                excellent mental fortitude, and contains the dedication to themselves that would make them above average employees.

                        Everyone loves the story of a comeback. Of someone successfully being able to beat the odds and improve their favor. We love seeing it in our news
                        , seeing it in movies, we love sharing these stories to inspire others. But, when have you or your organization ever had the chance to be a crucial player in these 
                        stories. What if, could lead the underdog to victory?(temp text, not sure if this is a message I want to go with).

                    <p>
                        A benefits package of any sort is not required to hire inmates they get all of their healthcare needs 
                        provided to them by the state and that means less money out of your pocket and more that you can invest 
                        back into the company.

                    <h3>Employees</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inmates will be held to just as high of a standard as any other employee and always have a reliable form 
                        of transportation provided by the state so you won't have to worry about them ever being late.
